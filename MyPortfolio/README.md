# DESIGN CHOICE
## In my design choice, i chose a single page only so it consist of home, about me, services, portfolio and contact. Then in  the color of my web page i chose the combination of gray, white and burlywood to make my webpage neat. This webpage is designed using a cool color palette to create a calm, professional, and refreshing user experience. Also i add phone and tablet css. These link  elements are used to create a responsive design, meaning the website will look and behave optimally on different screen sizes.


# CHALLENGES
## So in my webpage i don't have any idea how to embedd my projects in the portfolio part. So i check online some codes so  i can embedd some of my projects in my webpage. I include download attributes to the code so when it is clicked the  the user will be prompted to save it as a local file. That is how i embedd my projects to my webpage, also i include some images of my projects.
